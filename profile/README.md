## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Moonsync is a comprehensive womenâ€™s health knowledge engine that connects to your biometric data, helping women achieve peak performance. Women operate on a 28 day cycle, where each phase exhibits distinct characteristics around mood, nutrition, exercise, and skillset. Moonsync is powered by an LLM that combines your health stats and with existing research to provide women with clear answers. It's like taking the best advice from your therapist, health coach, PT, and doctor at a given moment. We synthesize all of it to better understand your health, reveal your strengths, and take action for you.
